Representative Eleanor Holmes Norton introduces the McIntire-Stennis Act District of Columbia Equality Act, which would make the District of Columbia eligible for funding under the McIntire-Stennis Cooperative Forestry Act in the same manner as states. The Act currently provides forestry research funding to states and certain territories, but excludes D.C. despite residents paying the same federal taxes as state residents.

Norton argues that D.C.'s exclusion is inequitable, especially since the Act defines "State" to include Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and Guam—whose residents do not pay full federal taxes. The proposed legislation would enable funding for the University of the District of Columbia's College of Agriculture, Urban Sustainability and Environmental Sciences, the nation's only urban land-grant university, ensuring equal treatment and fair resource allocation for D.C.

Input: 2623, Output: 209

The Rotorcraft Operations Transparency and Oversight Reform Act (ROTOR Act) is legislation that aims to improve aviation safety and transparency by requiring aircraft equipped with Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast In (ADS-B In) technology. The bill establishes clear definitions for key aviation terms and equipment while narrowly restricting exemptions from ADS-B Out transmission requirements, which previously allowed broad exceptions for "sensitive government missions."

The act requires the FAA to revise regulations within one year to limit ADS-B Out exemptions to only Cabinet-level federal officials and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, excluding routine, non-classified, and proficiency flights. It also mandates monthly congressional notifications of exempted flights in Class B airspace and requires the GAO to conduct a comprehensive review within two years to ensure compliance. Additionally, federal and state agencies must submit quarterly reports to the FAA attesting to their ADS-B Out transmissions and safety practices.

SKILLS-BASED FEDERAL CONTRACTING ACT OF 2025; Congressional Record Vol. 172, No. 35

Input: 2506, Output: 237

The Skills-Based Federal Contracting Act of 2025 (H.R. 5235) amends federal contracting law to prohibit minimum education requirements for contractor personnel unless contracting officers provide written justification explaining why such requirements are necessary to meet agency needs. The bill defines education requirements broadly to include degrees, coursework, or educational attainment from accredited institutions, and applies to solicitations issued 15 months after enactment. The Office of Management and Budget must issue implementation guidance within 180 days, and the Government Accountability Office must report on agency compliance within three years.

Supporters of the bill argue that it addresses unnecessary degree requirements that exclude qualified workers from federal contracts despite their technical skills and experience. Proponents contend that many jobs in fields like IT and construction can be performed through alternative pathways such as apprenticeships and boot camps, and that the federal government's massive contracting power should not artificially inflate degree requirements across the entire labor market. The bill aims to promote skills-based hiring and encourage companies using alternative credentialing and apprenticeship programs to compete for government contracts.

Input: 2547, Output: 211

The Information Quality Assurance Act of 2025 (H.R. 6329) amends federal law to strengthen oversight of information used by government agencies in developing rules and guidance. The bill requires the Office of Management and Budget to update guidelines within one year to ensure federal agencies rely on the best reasonably available scientific, technical, and statistical evidence when creating rules and informing the public. Each federal agency must then update its own guidelines to comply with these standards and establish mechanisms for the public to request corrections to inaccurate influential information.

The legislation also mandates increased transparency by requiring agencies to make critical factual materials and sources publicly available in rulemaking dockets and administrative records, generally before or at the time rules are issued. Exceptions apply for information protected by law, copyright, or patent rights, though agencies must explain why certain materials cannot be disclosed and describe efforts to increase access. The bill specifies that factual materials should be made available as open government data assets to maximize public access.

SMALL BUSINESS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ADVANCEMENT ACT; Congressional Record Vol. 172, No. 35

# Summary

The Small Business Artificial Intelligence Advancement Act (H.R. 3679) directs the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to develop and disseminate practical resources to help small businesses understand, adopt, and integrate artificial intelligence technologies. The resources must be generally applicable, technology-neutral, include case studies, and build upon existing federal educational frameworks. NIST is required to review and update these resources biennially and submit a report to Congress within four years detailing the resources developed and recommendations for further action.

Bipartisan supporters argue that while major U.S. companies are rapidly adopting AI, small businesses lack the capital and expertise to compete effectively. The bill aims to level the playing field by providing small businesses with voluntary guidance on AI adoption and risk management practices, ensuring that American entrepreneurship remains competitive globally and that AI benefits are accessible beyond large corporations with substantial budgets.

H.R. 2600, the "Accessing Satellite Capabilities to Enable New Discoveries Act" (ASCEND Act), authorizes NASA to establish a formal program to identify, evaluate, acquire, and disseminate commercial Earth remote sensing data and imagery. The bill builds on NASA's successful Commercial SmallSat Data Acquisition Pilot Program, which began in 2019 and demonstrated that commercially provided satellite data can effectively complement NASA's existing Earth observation capabilities. The legislation ensures that NASA can continue accessing cost-effective commercial data to advance scientific research while supporting U.S. space industry growth.

The bill establishes specific requirements for the program, including provisions that allow commercial data to be published for scientific purposes, prioritize procurement from U.S. vendors, and permit the widest possible use of acquired data by non-NASA-funded researchers and federal agencies. NASA is required to submit annual reports to Congress detailing all agreements, vendor licenses, and how each agreement advances scientific research aligned with recommendations from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.

H.R. 390, the Advanced Capabilities for Emergency Response Operations (ACERO) Act, is bipartisan legislation that directs NASA to leverage its advanced technologies and research capabilities to improve aerial responses to wildfires. The bill authorizes NASA to conduct research and development activities focused on advanced aircraft technologies, airspace management, real-time data sharing, and interoperable platforms to enhance coordination among Federal, State, and local agencies during wildfire response operations. It includes restrictions on procuring unmanned aircraft systems from covered foreign entities, with limited national interest exemptions subject to congressional notification.

The legislation addresses critical challenges in wildfire response, as aerial operations face obstacles such as heavy smoke limiting visibility and rapidly changing fire behavior complicating coordination among multiple aircraft. Supporters emphasize that NASA's expertise in aeronautics, airspace systems, and advanced technologies can significantly improve information sharing and situational awareness, ultimately enhancing the safety and effectiveness of wildfire response efforts and protecting the lives of first responders. The bill requires annual reports to Congress on progress through December 31, 2030.

Representative Aaron Bean of Florida delivered a Congressional tribute to Joe Leeper, a longtime Fernandina Beach resident who passed away at age 97. Leeper lived a life of quiet service, enlisting in the Navy in 1946 and serving during the Korean War, where he met his wife Alberta Jordan. He later became a police officer in Fernandina Beach and worked 27 years at Container Corporation before retiring.

Leeper's most significant impact was on youth in Nassau County, where he coached Little League championship teams and helped establish youth football programs that continue to serve thousands of children today. He also dedicated 62 years to the Shriners organization, participating in parades to raise money for sick children. Bean emphasized that Leeper never sought recognition but instead consistently showed up for his country, family, and community, leaving a lasting legacy in the lives of countless young people.

Congressman Murphy of North Carolina rose to memorialize Lance Corporal Chukwuemeka Oforah, a Marine stationed at Camp Lejeune who tragically died in a boating accident on February 7 while conducting operations in the Caribbean. Oforah fell overboard from the USS Iwo Jima, prompting a comprehensive 72-hour search-and-rescue operation involving the Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force, though his body was never recovered.

Oforah had enlisted in the Marine Corps in 2023, completed basic training at Parris Island in February 2024, and finished infantry school at Camp Lejeune before being assigned to the 3rd Battalion, 6th Marine Regiment. At the time of his death, he was deployed with Battalion Landing Team 3/6 and the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit. Murphy called for honoring Oforah's sacrifice and reaffirmed his commitment to supporting service members and their families.

Representative Subramanyam of Virginia delivered three separate remarks to the House. First, he honored the life of actor Robert Duvall, who passed away at age 95. Duvall was celebrated for his iconic film roles in works like "To Kill a Mockingbird" and "The Godfather," but was equally respected in his Virginia community as an Army veteran, dedicated environmentalist, and compassionate neighbor who supported local causes including a children's home in Winchester.

Subramanyam also paid tribute to Witold "Vic" Brick, a 103-year-old Polish World War II veteran from Loudoun County who fought in the Polish underground resistance against German occupation before being liberated by General Patton and later serving in the Polish 2nd Corps. Finally, Subramanyam criticized a Department of Veterans Affairs interim rule that would determine disability benefits based on a veteran's condition after taking medication rather than their underlying condition, arguing this flawed approach could discourage veterans from taking necessary medications and would fail those suffering from PTSD, traumatic brain injuries, and other service-related ailments.

Carthage, Maine, founded on February 20, 1826, is celebrating its 200th anniversary as a vibrant community in western Maine. The town was built on land previously used as hunting grounds by the Wabanaki people and developed after the Bowley family established sawmills and gristmills there starting in 1804. By the 1880s, Carthage had grown to over 500 residents and supported farms, mills, schools, and quarries, retaining its charm and natural beauty that continues to attract outdoor enthusiasts today.

The town is notable for its historical significance, including Newman Cemetery where Revolutionary War and Civil War veterans are buried, and for being the birthplace of Hiram Pitt Bennet in 1826, who later became a Colorado territorial delegate to Congress and advocate for Colorado's statehood. Carthage exemplifies Maine's thriving communities and pristine natural environment, with nearby attractions like Rocky Mountain Terrain Park and Mt. Blue State Park drawing visitors from across the region.

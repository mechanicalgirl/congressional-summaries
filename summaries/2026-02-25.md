INTRODUCTION OF THE McINTIRE-STENNIS ACT DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA EQUALITY ACT; Congressional Record Vol. 172, No. 35

Representative Eleanor Holmes Norton introduces the McIntire-Stennis Act District of Columbia Equality Act, which would make Washington, D.C. eligible for funding under the McIntire-Stennis Cooperative Forestry Act on the same basis as states. Currently, the Act provides forestry research funding to states and certain territories, but excludes D.C. despite its residents paying the same federal taxes as state residents.

Norton argues that D.C.'s exclusion is inequitable, particularly since the Act includes Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and Guam—territories whose residents do not pay full federal taxes. The legislation would enable funding for forestry research programs at the University of the District of Columbia's College of Agriculture, Urban Sustainability and Environmental Sciences, the nation's only urban land-grant university, ensuring D.C. receives fair treatment and resources comparable to other jurisdictions.

# Summary

The Rotorcraft Operations Transparency and Oversight Reform Act (ROTOR Act) aims to improve aviation safety and increase transparency by requiring aircraft to be equipped with Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast In (ADS-B In) technology. The bill narrows the definition of "sensitive government mission" exemptions that currently allow certain government aircraft to avoid transmitting ADS-B Out location data, restricting these exemptions to only Cabinet-level officials and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, while requiring monthly notifications to Congress about such operations in Class B airspace.

The legislation mandates that the FAA update its regulations within one year to implement these restrictions and establishes oversight mechanisms including a Government Accountability Office review within two years to examine compliance with the new rules. Federal, state, local, and tribal agencies must submit quarterly reports to the Administrator detailing their ADS-B operations and non-compliance instances, with provisions for the FAA to take action against agencies that fail to adhere to the revised regulations.

SKILLS-BASED FEDERAL CONTRACTING ACT OF 2025; Congressional Record Vol. 172, No. 35
https://www.congress.gov/119/crec/2026/02/23/172/35/modified/CREC-2026-02-23-pt1-PgH2247.htm
Input: 2506, Output: 211

The Skills-Based Federal Contracting Act of 2025 (H.R. 5235) prohibits federal agencies from setting minimum education requirements for contractor personnel unless contracting officers provide written justification explaining why such requirements are necessary to meet agency needs. The bill defines education broadly to include degrees, coursework, and other accredited educational attainment, and requires the Office of Management and Budget to issue implementation guidance within 180 days, with the new rules applying to solicitations issued 15 months after enactment.

Supporters argue the bill addresses unnecessary degree requirements that exclude skilled workers from federal contracting opportunities, particularly in fields like IT and construction where apprenticeships and boot camps provide viable alternatives to traditional degrees. Proponents contend that since over 77 percent of Americans lack bachelor's degrees and private employers have reduced degree requirements, federal contracting policies should similarly prioritize skills-based hiring to expand economic opportunity and encourage companies using alternative training pathways to compete for government contracts.

INFORMATION QUALITY ASSURANCE ACT OF 2025; Congressional Record Vol. 172, No. 35

The Information Quality Assurance Act of 2025 (H.R. 6329) mandates that federal agencies rely on the best available scientific, technical, demographic, economic, and statistical information when developing rules, issuing guidance, and informing the public. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget must update existing Information Quality Act guidelines within one year to provide federal agencies with policy guidance for ensuring quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity of influential information used in rulemaking and public communications.

Additionally, each federal agency must update its own guidelines to ensure reliance on the best reasonably available evidence in developing rules and guidance, publish these updated guidelines, and establish mechanisms for the public to request corrections to inaccurate influential information. The act requires agencies to make critical factual material and citations used in rulemaking publicly available in regulatory dockets or administrative records as soon as reasonably possible, preferably before public comment periods, with exceptions for information protected by law or intellectual property rights.

SMALL BUSINESS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ADVANCEMENT ACT; Congressional Record Vol. 172, No. 35
https://www.congress.gov/119/crec/2026/02/23/172/35/modified/CREC-2026-02-23-pt1-PgH2244.htm
Input: 2428, Output: 228

H.R. 3679, the Small Business Artificial Intelligence Advancement Act, directs the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to develop and disseminate resources to help small businesses understand and adopt artificial intelligence technologies. The resources would include technical standards, best practices, case studies, and risk management guidance, and must be technology-neutral, applicable to various business sizes and types, and coordinated through the Small Business Administration. NIST is required to review and update these resources every two years and submit a report to Congress four years after enactment.

Bipartisan supporters argue that while major U.S. companies are rapidly integrating AI into their operations, small businesses lack the capital and expertise to fully leverage AI's potential. This legislation aims to level the playing field by providing practical, voluntary guidance on AI adoption and cybersecurity practices, ensuring that small businesses—which represent nearly 43 percent of U.S. GDP and employ 46 percent of the workforce—can remain competitive in the global AI race without the enormous investment required by larger corporations.

The ASCEND Act (Accessing Satellite Capabilities to Enable New Discoveries Act) establishes a formal program within NASA to acquire and disseminate cost-effective commercial Earth remote sensing data and imagery to support scientific, operational, and educational requirements. The bill codifies NASA's successful Commercial SmallSat Data Acquisition Pilot Program, which was established in 2019 and demonstrated that commercial satellite data can effectively complement NASA's existing Earth observation capabilities while supporting the growth of the U.S. space economy.

The legislation authorizes NASA to procure commercial Earth remote sensing data primarily from United States vendors, requires publication of data for scientific purposes, and mandates annual reporting to Congress on vendor agreements, license terms, and how the data advances scientific research. The bill ensures NASA can continue leveraging cost-effective commercial satellite capabilities while maintaining transparency and expanding access to federally funded researchers and other government agencies.

Input: 2437, Output: 212

H.R. 390, the Advanced Capabilities for Emergency Response Operations (ACERO) Act, is bipartisan legislation that directs NASA to leverage its research and development expertise to improve aerial responses to wildfires. The bill authorizes NASA to conduct research on advanced aircraft technologies, airspace management, real-time data sharing platforms, and multi-agency coordination systems to enhance wildfire response efforts while enabling collaboration with federal, state, local, and commercial partners.

The legislation addresses critical challenges in wildfire operations, including limited visibility from heavy smoke, coordination difficulties among multiple aircraft, and airspace management complications. The bill also includes a prohibition on procuring unmanned aircraft systems manufactured by covered foreign entities, with a national security waiver available on a case-by-case basis, and requires annual reporting to Congress on NASA's activities and findings through 2030. Supporters emphasize that these advanced technologies can reduce risk to first responders while improving detection, suppression, and coordination during wildfire emergencies.

Representative Thompson of Pennsylvania delivered a tribute to Arden Tewksbury, a prominent dairy advocate and community leader who passed away on January 30 at age 93. Tewksbury was a multi-sport athlete despite losing his arm in a childhood accident, served as a Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association basketball official, and most notably spent 64 years as a volunteer school board member for Elk Lake School District.

Throughout his career, Tewksbury became a respected advocate for dairy farmers, operating his own farm in northeastern Pennsylvania until his 2003 retirement and serving on numerous agricultural boards and committees. He founded the Progressive Agriculture Organization in 1991 to fight for fair milk prices for small family farms, worked with former Senator Arlen Specter on milk pricing legislation, and recently witnessed the passage of the bipartisan Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act of 2025. Tewksbury was honored as Pennsylvania State Granger of the Year in 1987 and left a lasting legacy as a role model across the Commonwealth.

Congressman Aaron Bean of Florida delivered a tribute to Joe Leeper of Fernandina Beach, who passed away at age 97 after a lifetime of service to his community. Born in 1928, Leeper served honorably in the U.S. Navy during the Korean War, where he met his wife Alberta Jordan. He later became a police officer in Fernandina Beach and spent 27 years working at Container Corporation before retirement.

Leeper's most significant legacy was his profound impact on youth in Nassau County through decades of volunteer work. He coached Little League championship teams, helped establish youth football programs that continue to serve thousands of children today, and spent 62 years as a Shriner, using parades and community events to raise funds for sick children. Though he never sought recognition, Leeper's consistent dedication to his country, family, and community left an enduring mark that continues through the programs and lives he touched.

Congressman Subramanyam of Virginia addresses the House to honor the lives of notable individuals from his district. He pays tribute to actor Robert Duvall, who passed away at age 95, recognizing both his legendary film career and his character as a humble Army veteran and dedicated community member in Fauquier County who supported local causes and children's organizations. He also honors Witold "Vic" Brick, a 103-year-old World War II veteran who fought in the Polish underground resistance against German occupation and later served with the Polish 2nd Corps before immigrating to America, where he remained grateful for his opportunities as a citizen.

Additionally, Congressman Subramanyam expresses concerns about a Veterans Affairs interim rule that would determine disability benefits based on veterans' condition after taking medication rather than their underlying conditions. He argues this flawed approach creates perverse incentives for veterans not to take necessary medications and leaves those relying on these treatments—for PTSD, chronic pain, traumatic brain injuries, and other service-related ailments—in limbo, calling for the rule to be eliminated entirely.

Carthage, Maine, founded on February 20, 1826, is celebrating its 200th anniversary as a thriving community in western Maine. The town was built on land previously used as hunting grounds by the Wabanaki people and developed after William Bowley and his family established sawmills and gristmills along Webb River beginning in 1804. By the 1880s, Carthage had grown to over 500 residents with farms, mills, schools, and quarries, and today it retains its natural charm while attracting outdoor enthusiasts to nearby parks.

The town's rich history is evident in its landmarks, including Newman Cemetery where founding families and Revolutionary War and Civil War veterans are buried. Notable among Carthage's contributions to American history is Hiram Pitt Bennet, born in the town in 1826, who later moved to Colorado and served as a territorial delegate to Congress, advocating for Colorado's statehood. Carthage exemplifies Maine's combination of thriving communities and pristine natural beauty.

# Summary

Senator Schumer criticizes President Trump's tariff policies, stating that Americans are suffering from increased costs on groceries, cars, homes, and other goods. He notes that while the Supreme Court recently ruled the President cannot unilaterally raise tariffs without Congressional approval, Trump quickly reimposed and doubled down on tariffs anyway. Schumer pledges that Democrats will not extend the tariffs when they expire in a few months and calls on Republicans to join them in opposing these "odious tariffs" that burden American families.

Senators Moreno and Barrasso deliver tributes to Roger S. Penske on his 89th birthday and the 60th anniversary of Team Penske. They highlight Penske's extraordinary accomplishments as both a racing legend and business titan, including 20 Indianapolis 500 victories, 48 national championships, and leadership of Penske Corporation, which employs tens of thousands across all 50 states. The senators praise Penske's guiding principle of "effort equals results," his receipt of the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2019, and his upcoming role in organizing the first-ever INDYCAR street race in Washington D.C. as part of America's 250th anniversary celebration.

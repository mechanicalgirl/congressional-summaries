INTRODUCTION OF THE McINTIRE-STENNIS ACT DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA EQUALITY ACT; Congressional Record Vol. 172, No. 35

Representative Eleanor Holmes Norton introduced the McIntire-Stennis Act District of Columbia Equality Act, which would extend funding eligibility under the McIntire-Stennis Cooperative Forestry Act to Washington, D.C. in the same manner as states. The Act currently provides funding to states and certain territories for forestry research programs, but inexplicably excludes D.C., despite the fact that D.C. residents pay the same federal taxes as state residents and are typically treated as states under federal programs.

Norton argues that D.C.'s exclusion is inequitable, particularly since the Act's definition of "State" includes Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and Guam—territories whose residents do not pay full federal taxes. The bill would enable the University of the District of Columbia's College of Agriculture, Urban Sustainability and Environmental Sciences, the nation's only urban land-grant university, to access these research funds to support its forestry and environmental programs that serve D.C. and the broader region.

ROTORCRAFT OPERATIONS TRANSPARENCY AND OVERSIGHT REFORM ACT; Congressional Record Vol. 172, No. 35

Input: 2623, Output: 211

The Rotorcraft Operations Transparency and Oversight Reform Act (ROTOR Act) is legislation that requires aircraft to be equipped with Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast In (ADS-B In) technology to improve aviation safety. The bill narrows the definition of "sensitive government mission" exemptions that allow certain aircraft to avoid transmitting ADS-B Out signals, restricting these exemptions to only classified flights and those carrying Cabinet Members or the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, while excluding routine, non-classified, and proficiency flights.

The legislation mandates that the FAA update regulations within one year to reflect these stricter definitions and requires operating agencies to notify Air Traffic Control and Congress monthly when conducting sensitive missions without ADS-B Out transmission. Additionally, the bill directs the Government Accountability Office to review how federal agencies utilize these exceptions within two years and report findings to Congress, with the FAA subsequently determining whether non-compliant operators should retain their exemption privileges.

SKILLS-BASED FEDERAL CONTRACTING ACT OF 2025; Congressional Record Vol. 172, No. 35

Input: 2506, Output: 235

The Skills-Based Federal Contracting Act of 2025 (H.R. 5235) aims to eliminate unnecessary degree requirements in federal contracting by prohibiting minimum education requirements for contractor personnel unless contracting officers provide written justification explaining why such requirements are essential to meet agency needs. The bill defines education broadly to include degrees, coursework, and other accredited educational attainment, and encourages the use of skills-based hiring alternatives such as apprenticeships and boot camps.

Supporters argue that the legislation addresses an important gap in federal hiring practices, noting that over 77 percent of Americans lack bachelor's degrees and that many possess valuable skills through non-traditional pathways. The bill requires the Office of Management and Budget to issue implementation guidance within 180 days, applies to solicitations issued 15 months after enactment, and mandates a Government Accountability Office report on agency compliance within three years. Proponents contend that federal contracting practices significantly influence the broader labor market and that removing artificial degree barriers will expand economic opportunity for skilled workers while enabling qualified companies to compete for government contracts.

INFORMATION QUALITY ASSURANCE ACT OF 2025; Congressional Record Vol. 172, No. 35

The Information Quality Assurance Act of 2025 requires the Office of Management and Budget to update federal guidelines within one year to ensure that federal agencies use the best available scientific, technical, demographic, economic, and statistical information when developing rules, issuing guidance, and informing the public. The updated guidelines must focus on improving the quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity of influential information and evidence used in these processes.

Additionally, each federal agency must update its own guidelines to comply with these standards and publish them publicly. The act mandates that agencies make critical factual material and source citations available in rulemaking dockets or administrative records, with provisions for public notice and comment periods. Exceptions are permitted for information protected by law, intellectual property rights, or confidentiality requirements, though agencies must explain why information cannot be disclosed and describe steps to increase access where possible.

SMALL BUSINESS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ADVANCEMENT ACT; Congressional Record Vol. 172, No. 35

Input: 2428, Output: 228

The Small Business Artificial Intelligence Advancement Act (H.R. 3679) directs the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to develop and disseminate resources to help small businesses understand and adopt artificial intelligence technologies. The resources must be generally applicable across various business sizes and types, include practical case studies, be technology-neutral, and incorporate existing federal educational resources on risk management, privacy, and cybersecurity. NIST is required to review and update these resources every two years and coordinate with the Small Business Administration for distribution, while also submitting a report to Congress within four years detailing the resources developed and recommendations for further action.

Bipartisan supporters argue that while major U.S. companies are rapidly integrating AI into their operations, small businesses lack the capital and expertise to fully leverage these technologies and remain competitive globally. This legislation aims to level the playing field by providing small businesses with practical, voluntary guidance on adopting AI tools and managing associated risks, ensuring that AI's benefits are accessible to all American businesses, not just those with the largest budgets.

ACCESSING SATELLITE CAPABILITIES TO ENABLE NEW DISCOVERIES ACT; Congressional Record Vol. 172, No. 35

H.R. 2600, the "Accessing Satellite Capabilities to Enable New Discoveries Act" (ASCEND Act), establishes a formal program within NASA to identify, evaluate, acquire, and disseminate commercial Earth remote sensing data and imagery to support scientific, operational, and educational requirements. The legislation builds upon NASA's successful Commercial SmallSat Data Acquisition Pilot Program, which demonstrated that commercially provided satellite datasets can effectively complement NASA's existing Earth observation capabilities. The bill mandates that commercial data procurement prioritize U.S. vendors and allow for publication and wider dissemination of both the raw commercial data and derived information.

The ASCEND Act requires the NASA Administrator to submit annual reports to Congress detailing vendor agreements, license terms, and the advancement of scientific research through these commercial partnerships. The legislation emphasizes cost-effectiveness and maintains transparency regarding end-use license conditions, ensuring that commercial satellite data can be accessed by NASA-funded researchers, federal agencies, and non-federal users. Both sponsors and supporting members highlighted how the bill supports the growing space economy while strengthening U.S. leadership in space exploration and Earth science research.

ADVANCED CAPABILITIES FOR EMERGENCY RESPONSE OPERATIONS ACT; Congressional Record Vol. 172, No. 35

Input: 2437, Output: 254

H.R. 390, the Advanced Capabilities for Emergency Response Operations (ACERO) Act, is bipartisan legislation that directs NASA to leverage its research and development expertise to improve aerial responses to wildfires. The bill authorizes NASA to conduct activities including developing advanced aircraft technologies for airspace management, creating information-sharing platforms for wildfire response teams, establishing interoperable systems for situational awareness, and coordinating multi-agency aerial operations involving federal, state, and local agencies. The legislation also includes restrictions on procuring unmanned aircraft systems from covered foreign entities, with case-by-case exemptions when determined to be in the national interest, and requires annual reporting to Congress through 2030.

Supporters emphasized that wildfires cause billions in damage annually and that aerial capabilities are critical for detection, suppression, and monitoring. They noted that unmanned aircraft systems present new opportunities to enhance operations while reducing risk to human life, though current wildfire operations face significant challenges including poor visibility from smoke and coordination difficulties among multiple aircraft. The bill represents a practical application of American innovation to protect lives, including those of first responders, by providing them with advanced tools and better coordination capabilities during wildfire events.

Courtney expressed concern that neither the Commander in Chief nor Navy leadership had publicly acknowledged Denmark's humanitarian act, and he used his position as a representative of the USS Delaware's home port and ranking member of the Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee to formally thank Denmark and Greenland for their care and solidarity with the U.S. service member.

Representative Subramanyam of Virginia delivered remarks honoring actor Robert Duvall, who passed away on February 15 at age 95. Duvall was celebrated as an iconic actor known for legendary roles in films like "To Kill a Mockingbird" and "The Godfather," but he was equally respected in his Virginia community as an Army veteran, dedicated environmentalist, and generous neighbor who supported local causes including a children's home in Winchester.

The representative also paid tribute to Witold "Vic" Brick, a 103-year-old World War II veteran and Loudoun County resident who fought with the Polish underground resistance against German occupation before being liberated by General Patton and later serving with the Polish 2nd Corps. Additionally, Subramanyam criticized a Department of Veterans Affairs interim rule that would base disability benefit ratings on veterans' condition after medication rather than their underlying disabilities, arguing the policy creates perverse incentives and fails veterans who depend on these medications for managing PTSD, chronic pain, and other service-related ailments.

Carthage, Maine celebrates its 200th anniversary on February 20, 2026, having been founded in 1826 on land previously used as hunting grounds by the Wabanaki people. The town was established after the Bowley family arrived in 1804 and built the first sawmill on Webb River, followed by a gristmill. By the 1880s, Carthage had grown to over 500 residents and supported farms, multiple sawmills, schools, and a limestone quarry, with its economy historically centered on forests and agriculture.

Today, Carthage retains its natural charm and attracts outdoor enthusiasts to nearby Rocky Mountain Terrain Park and Mt. Blue State Park. The town is home to notable historical sites like Newman Cemetery, which honors founding families and veterans of the Revolutionary War and Civil War, and is the birthplace of Hiram Pitt Bennet, who became a territorial delegate to Congress and advocated for Colorado's statehood. Senator Collins celebrates Carthage as an exemplary Maine community that demonstrates the state's thriving towns and pristine natural beauty.

# Summary

In a Senate session, Democratic leader Senator Schumer criticized President Trump's tariff policies, arguing they are causing inflation and raising costs for American families on groceries, cars, homes, and other goods. He noted that while the Supreme Court recently blocked Trump's emergency tariff authority, the President reimposed and then increased tariffs anyway. Schumer pledged that Democrats will not extend the new tariff regime when it expires in a few months and called on Republicans to join them in opposing these "odious tariffs."

Senators Moreno and Barrasso then delivered tributes to legendary businessman and racing magnate Roger S. Penske on his 89th birthday and the 60th anniversary of Team Penske. They highlighted his remarkable accomplishments, including 20 Indianapolis 500 victories, 48 national championships, and leadership of the Penske Corporation, a global transportation and automotive powerhouse employing tens of thousands across all 50 states. Both senators praised Penske's guiding principle of "effort equals results" and his embodiment of American entrepreneurship and excellence.
